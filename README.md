# Hand_Holding_bot
To work with this robot you need to work with both raspberry pi and arduino at the same time. Connect the raspi and Arduino with the given trigger pins. On the Arduino side connect the Gyroscope MPU6050 and three ultrasonic sensor with it. Run the raspberry files and Arduino files connecting them with serial USB. 
Speak your destination. It will be converted to text in python using google APi. It will be sent to Arduino in which the floor map is fed.It will start moving. Simultaneously, the raspberry pi will send immediate path gird to Arduino which is formed using ground segregation techniques using Image Processing taking image from camera attached to a desired height. The robotâ€™s chassis is 4 wheel macnum drive. When connected properly the robot will start traversing the path it is destined to. You can set the proportional and differential error accordingly.
